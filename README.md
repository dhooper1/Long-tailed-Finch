# Spread of yellow bill color alleles favored by selection in the long-tailed finch hybrid system

This is the repository of supplementary data tables and project scripts related to the project: "Spread of yellow bill color alleles favored by selection in the long-tailed finch hybrid system". In this work, we study bill color evolution in an Australian songbird called the long-tailed finch, which consists of two subspecies *Poephila a. acuticauda* and *Poephila a. hecki* that differ strikingly in this trait. We describe the carotenoid composition of each subspecies' bills and find that they differ due to a single enzymatic process that converts yellow-orange dietary carotenoids to red ketocarotenoids: namely a lack of C(4)-oxidation in the yellow bills of subspecies *acuticauda*. In a genome-wide association study for bill color using genomic data from wild-sampled and captive-reared finches, we identify a small number of loci that explain most variation in color. The two most strongly associated regions contain the gene *CYP2J19*, an enzyme essential for the C(4)-oxidation of red ketocarotenoids, and *TTC39B*, a gene shown to potently increase the rate of ketocarotenoid production. We report that yellow bill color alleles are derived and show evidence at multiple loci of introgression from *acuticauda* into *hecki*. Altogether, we highlight how selection on putatively *cis*-regulatory changes at a few interacting carotenoid processing genes led to the initial divergence in bill color between subspecies ~100 kya and the subsequent adaptive introgression of these alleles more recently.
