# Adaptive introgression of carotenoid processing genes across the long-tailed finch hybrid zone

This is the repository of supplementary data tables and project code related to long-tailed finch haplotagging project: "Adaptive introgression of carotenoid processing genes across the long-tailed finch hybrid zone".

### Supplementary Data Tables

- *carotenoid_composition.csv* Bill tissue carotenoid composition of each long-tailed finch subspecies as measured by HPLC
- *bill_color_H3.csv* Bill color phenotype data for 1498 wild-caught and captive-reared long-tailed finch samples
- *metadata_LR.csv* Metadata, sequencing results, and haplotagging performance for linked-read (LR) WGS samples
- *metadata_SR.csv* Metadata and sequencing results for short-read (SR) WGS samples
- *hybrid_index.csv* Hybrid index inference for 984 wild-caught samples, inferred using [gghybrid](https://github.com/ribailey/gghybrid)
- *gwas_association_peaks.csv* Summary of eleven bill color association peaks identified by genome-wide association studies, inferred using [GEMMA](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA)
- *geographic_cline_results.csv* Geographic cline data for bill color associated SNPs and hybrid index, inferred using [BAHZ](https://github.com/tjthurman/BAHZ)
- *genomic_cline_results.csv* Genomic cline results for 649 ancestry informative SNPs in hybrid index, inferred using [gghybrid](https://github.com/ribailey/gghybrid)
- *phasing_performance.csv* Phasing performance (N50) on chr2, chr8, and chrZ for LR and SR samples, calculated using [HapCUT2](https://github.com/vibansal/HapCUT2)
